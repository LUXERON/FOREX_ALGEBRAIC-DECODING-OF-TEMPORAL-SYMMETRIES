CTRADER AND PEPPERSTONE


SO IN MY ALGORITHM, THE DETAILS I GOT FROM CTRADER AND THE ONES I GOT FROM PEPPERSTONE IS WHAT I WILL USE IN MY SCRIPT? :

Your cTrader live account has been created

Login: 1259560
Server: cTraderLIVE
Leverage: 1:200
Currency: USD

DonAlgoTrader
Client ID :
14877_vyfOpsRldMcTyq4M2Qien3KxqG43yVFlSt0jLNjBhr0LX2Cpd7

Secret
smo86RDCn85U5Fy5hIuCi4oScBJMiKwlEt3x0zxBC406ioUioE


YES â€” THESE ARE THE TWO CRITICAL PARTS YOUR ALGORITHM NEEDS
Hereâ€™s exactly how each set of details is used in your algorithm:

ðŸ”‘ 1. APPLICATION CREDENTIALS (FOR AUTH)
From your Spotware Developer App (DonAlgoTrader):
Client ID:
14877_vyfOpsRldMcTyq4M2Qien3KxqG43yVFlSt0jLNjBhr0LX2Cpd7
Client Secret:
smo86RDCn85U5Fy5hIuCi4oScBJMiKwlEt3x0zxBC406ioUioE
These are used in your algorithm to initiate the OAuth2 login flow.
This allows the cTrader API to grant your algorithm an access token and refresh token.

ðŸ‘¤ 2. CTRADER ACCOUNT DETAILS (FOR TRADING SESSION)
From your Pepperstone-issued cTrader Live account:
Login: 1259560
Server: cTrader LIVE
This is your actual live trading account, funded via Pepperstone, but accessible via cTrader API.
You'll use this when:
Logging in during OAuth (youâ€™ll be prompted for this cTrader login)
Accessing specific account info or placing trades via the access token you get

ðŸ§  YOUR SCRIPT FLOW (SIMPLIFIED):
Request OAuth2 Authorization URL using your client_id
Log in using your cTrader Live account (1259560, cTrader LIVE)
Get redirected back to your redirect URI with an auth_code
Exchange auth_code for access token using your client_id + client_secret
Use access token to:
Get account balances
Place orders
Retrieve positions, etc.

âœ… TO SUM IT UP:
What
Used For
Source
Client ID + Secret
Authenticate & get tokens
Spotware Developer Portal
Login + Server
Identify the trading account
Pepperstone/cTrader Account

Would you like a Python starter template that connects to Spotwareâ€™s cTrader API using these credentials, fetches account balance, and prints it?


SO JUST PROVIDING YOUR LAST RESPONSE TO AN LLM CODING AGENT WILL ENABLE THEM DEVELOP IN C# THE API ACCESS REQUIRED FOR MY FOREX TRADING ALGORITHM?


YES â€” BUT WITH ONE IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION
Your last response gives a good foundation, but to enable an LLM coding agent to fully implement C# access to the cTrader Open API, you'd need to give it one more thing:

âœ… WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE (GOOD):
Client ID & Secret â€” needed for OAuth2
cTrader Live Account Login & Server â€” for account identification
Context about using Pepperstone through cTrader â€” important clarity

ðŸ”§ WHAT YOU NEED TO ADD:
Mention you're targeting Spotwareâ€™s cTrader Open API v2
Clarify that the agent must implement OAuth2 token retrieval flow
Specify that the project should use WebSockets â€” since cTrader Open API is WebSocket-based, not REST

ðŸ”„ IDEAL PROMPT TO GIVE AN LLM CODING AGENT (C# VERSION)
I want to build a C# application that connects to my Pepperstone cTrader account using Spotwareâ€™s Open API (cTrader Open API v2).

Here are my credentials:

- Client ID: 14877_vyfOpsRldMcTyq4M2Qien3KxqG43yVFlSt0jLNjBhr0LX2Cpd7
- Client Secret: smo86RDCn85U5Fy5hIuCi4oScBJMiKwlEt3x0zxBC406ioUioE
- cTrader Live Account ID: 1259560
- Server: cTrader LIVE

The application should:
1. Authenticate using OAuth2
2. Use the access token to open a WebSocket connection to the cTrader API
3. Retrieve account balance and open positions
4. Be ready to place trades later

Use WebSocketSharp or any library suitable for WebSocket communication in C#. You can refer to Spotware's documentation here: https://connect.spotware.com/

Start with token retrieval, then WebSocket session establishment.

This will enable the LLM to build a working scaffold in C# that can:
Authenticate properly
Connect to the live trading account
Execute logic as your trading algorithm requires



SO JUST CHANGING THE SERVER TO cTrader DEMO + THE SAME CLIENT ID AND SECRET IS ALL I NEED TO USE THE DEMO ACCOUNT

YES â€” THATâ€™S EXACTLY RIGHT âœ…
You do NOT need a separate Client ID and Secret for demo.

âœ… TO USE YOUR DEMO ACCOUNT:
Just ensure these are correct in your authentication flow:
Parameter
Value (for demo)
Client ID
14877_vyfOpsRldMcTyq4M2Qien3KxqG43yVFlSt0jLNjBhr0LX2Cpd7
Client Secret
smo86RDCn85U5Fy5hIuCi4oScBJMiKwlEt3x0zxBC406ioUioE
Account Login
e.g., 5078436 (from your demo account)
Server
cTrader DEMO

âœ… JUST REMEMBER:
When logging in to authorize your app (via browser redirect or embedded browser), enter your cTrader demo credentials.
The access token you receive will be tied to the demo account, so it wonâ€™t touch live trading.

Would you like a walkthrough of how to authenticate and connect in code using these demo credentials?
