Laplacian-Based Attention Q-Learning Framework Using De Bruijn Graphs and Particle Mesh Ewald
Abstract
Traditional deep Q-learning relies on neural networks to approximate Q-values in continuous state-action spaces. However, the computational overhead and inefficiencies in neural networks limit their scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach that replaces neural networks with a De Bruijn graph structure and utilizes the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method to approximate Q-values efficiently. Additionally, a Laplacian-based attention mechanism is introduced to refine state-action evaluations, enhancing exploration and policy learning. This method offers a scalable, memory-efficient, and computationally optimal solution for reinforcement learning in high-dimensional environments.
1. Introduction
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, particularly deep Q-learning, typically employ neural networks to estimate Q-values. However, training deep networks in continuous state spaces suffers from high computational costs and slow convergence rates. This work introduces an alternative framework using:
De Bruijn graphs for efficient state-action representation.
Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) for smooth Q-value approximation.
Laplacian-based attention to optimize state-action importance weighting.
2. Key Components of the Framework
2.1 De Bruijn Graph Structure for State Representation
A De Bruijn graph efficiently encodes state transitions:
Each node represents a discretized segment of the continuous state space.
Edges represent possible state transitions based on action selection.
Compact structure ensures efficient memory usage and systematic exploration.
2.2 Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) for Continuous State Approximation
The PME method provides:
Smooth approximations over continuous state-action spaces.
Reduced computational complexity by separating real-space and reciprocal-space interactions.
Improved Q-value estimation by mitigating local approximation errors.
2.3 Laplacian-Based Attention Mechanism
A graph Laplacian (L) is computed from the De Bruijn graph:
Eigenvectors of L encode global structure information.
Graph Fourier Transform is applied to extract state importance.
Attention weights prioritize influential states for Q-value updates.
3. Integration into Q-Learning
3.1 State and Action Representation
States are mapped into the De Bruijn graph.
Actions correspond to valid transitions within the graph.
3.2 Q-Value Calculation
PME is used to approximate Q-values for each state-action pair.
Laplacian-based attention refines Q-values by emphasizing important transitions.
Updates follow the Bellman equation with enhanced state weighting:Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+α(r+γmaxa′Q(s′,a′)−Q(s,a))Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha (r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a))
3.3 Exploration Strategy
The De Bruijn structure ensures systematic exploration.
Laplacian attention improves efficiency by focusing on high-impact transitions.
